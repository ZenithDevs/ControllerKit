ControllerKit is a simple JavaScript library that wraps touch, keyboard, and gamepad inputs all into one easy-to-use interface. It's easy to setup and to use.

## Get Started
Setup is very simple, all you need to do is install the package:
```shell
$ npm i @zenithdevs/controllerkit
```
And to use:
```js
import ControllerKit from '@zenithdevs/controllerkit';

const controls = new ControllerKit()
```

That's it! Everything is now setup, however you should probably look into configuring everything... so check out the [docs](https://zenithdevs.com/controllerkit)!
